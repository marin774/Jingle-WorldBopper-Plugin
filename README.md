# Jingle WorldBopper Plugin
A Jingle plugin which keeps your saves folder under a certain size. This reduces disk space usage, and it helps MultiMC load instance settings faster (since it has fewer worlds to load).

## Installation
Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/marin774/Jingle-Worldbopper-Plugin/releases). Drag and drop it into your Jingle plugins folder, and restart Jingle.

## Setup
Once you've installed the plugin and restarted Jingle, enable the plugin and configure it:
1. Open the "Plugins" tab in Jingle.
2. Enable WorldBopper by clicking on the "Enable WorldBopper?" checkbox.
   
You can now configure the plugin.

## Config
- **Enable WorldBopper** - Whether worlds should be actively bopped or not.
- **Boppable worlds** - You can define custom world prefixes, and what to do with such worlds. For example, all world names beginning with `Random Speedrun #` will be deleted if they don't reach a bastion, otherwise they will stay in the saves folder and not get deleted. World names that aren't listed here will NOT be deleted.
